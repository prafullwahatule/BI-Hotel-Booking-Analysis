# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis – Power BI Project  
  

## 📌 Project Overview

The Hotel Booking Analysis project aims to uncover key business insights hidden within hotel booking data. Using Power BI, the project analyzes guest behavior, booking patterns, room and meal performance, cancellation trends, and revenue metrics.

The dashboard is built after performing data cleaning, transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and KPI creation.
It consists of 4 interactive pages covering:

Overview & Key Metrics

Guest & Booking Analysis

Room, Meal & Channel Performance

Cancellation & Revenue Insights

This project helps hotel management improve operations, reduce cancellations, enhance guest experience, and boost revenue through data-driven decisions.

##❗ Problem Statement

Hotels receive large volumes of bookings every day through various channels. However, they face major challenges:

High cancellation and no-show rates

Lack of clarity on booking trends and guest demographics

Difficulty identifying profitable room types, meal plans, and booking channels

Limited understanding of revenue lost due to cancellations

No clear insights into guest loyalty and repeat customer behavior

Inability to forecast demand due to scattered lead time patterns

Uncertainty about which distribution channels are reliable or risky

Due to these challenges, hotel businesses struggle to optimize operations, reduce revenue leakage, and make strategic decisions.
