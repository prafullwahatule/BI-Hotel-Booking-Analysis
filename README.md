# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis – Power BI Project  

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI-based interactive analytics solution designed to uncover insights from hotel booking data.
The dashboard provides deep visibility into guest behavior 👥, booking trends 📅, room & meal performance 🛏️🍽️, distribution channels 🌐, cancellations ❌, and revenue insights 💰.
It enables hotel managers to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and reduce revenue loss.

The project includes data cleaning, transformation, modeling, DAX measures, KPIs, and four fully interactive dashboard pages.  

## ❗ Problem Statement

### Hotels receive thousands of bookings through multiple channels but struggle with:

- High cancellation and no-show rates affect revenue

- Lack of visibility into guest demographics and booking patterns

- Difficulty identifying top-performing room types, meal plans & channels

- No clear measurement of revenue lost due to cancellations

- Limited insight into repeat guest behavior & loyalty

- Hard to forecast demand due to scattered lead time and seasonal trends

- Uncertainty about which booking channels are profitable or risky

- Due to these issues, hotels face challenges in making strategic decisions, optimizing operations, and increasing profitability.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Centralize Booking Data 🗂️: Create a unified, analytics-ready dataset for hotel booking performance.

- Understand Guest Behavior 👥: Analyze customer types, repeat vs new guests, and booking preferences.

- Track Key Hotel Metrics 📊: Monitor total bookings, total guests, revenue, ADR, and room utilization.

- Analyze Room & Meal Performance 🛏️🍽️: Identify preferred room types, popular meal plans, and upgrade patterns.

- Evaluate Channel Performance 🌐: Compare distribution channels based on revenue, cancellations, and booking volume.

- Understand Cancellations ❌: Identify cancellation patterns by month, customer type, deposit type, and channel.

- Measure Revenue Loss & Retention 💰: Calculate revenue leakage due to cancellations and overall retention rate.

- Support Decision-Making 🧠: Provide hotels with interactive dashboards to drill down insights for strategic planning.
